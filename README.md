# Web Development Lab 03 
According to the requirements laid out by Lab 03:

In this lab, we’ll build a web application using the Streamlit Python library, which lets you turn Python code into interactive apps and dashboards that can be hosted online.

Our app will include:

	•	A portfolio or resume (2 pages, one for each team member)
	•	A tool that uses data from a web API you choose
	•	A feature using a large language model (like ChatGPT) to further analyze the API data

All main coding content is located in the folder WebDevelopmentLab03.


# Step 1: Creating A Portfolio

To start, each of us will create a personal portfolio section that shares background information and highlights different aspects about ourselves. Each person is responsible for building their own portfolio.
